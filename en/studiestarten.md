<p>The study start hires around {{layout.numOfVectors}} vectors divided into {{layout.numOfKABS}} groups. Together they welcome the russes that begin in August. This is coordinated by 30 KABS, that takes care of educational days, OPtur, study programmes and much more related to the study start. KABS, vectors and hyttebumser jointly creates the best possible study start for the russes.
