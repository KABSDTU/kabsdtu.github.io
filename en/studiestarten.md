<p>
In the study start, almost 300 vectors are employed, divided into 28 cross-teams for the summer start, who altogether welcome the new russes who start their studies in August this summer. For the winter start around {{layout.numOfWVectors}} vectors are hired, divided into {{layout.numOfWCKABS}} cross-teams, who welcome the new students in January 2024. <br>
This is all coordinated by a total of {{layout.numOfKABS}} KABS, who are in charge of the vector education days, OPtur, and many other activities related to the studystart. <br>
KABS, vectors and cabin bums jointly create the best possible rustrip and studystart experience for the future russes.
