<h1>The Study Start</h1>

<p>
In the study start, almost 300 vectors are employed, divided into 20 - 30 different cross-teams for the summer start, who altogether welcome the new russes who start their studies in August this summer.  <br>
This is all coordinated by a total of <b> {{layout.numOfKABS}} </b> KABS, who are in charge of the vector education days, OPtur, and many other activities related to the studystart. <br>
KABS, vectors and cabin bums jointly create the best possible introday/s and study start experience for the future russes.
</p>

<h2>New study start </h2>

<p>
It's no secret that the study start this year will take place in an new way. The rustrips will no longer be held, and we will do campus tours/intro days instead. However, this does not mean that the study start will be worse, and as a vector this year you will also have a huge opportunity to help shape the new study start here DTU. <br>
We in KABS (Coordinators of Bachelor Study Start) are doing a lot about setting the framework for the new study start, and making it all fit together. <br>
The study start in study-line teams will be the same as before with a welcome day, cake groups and a cabin trip as you know it. <br>

<!-- Vinterstart er d?d :(
For the winter start around {{layout.numOfWVectors}} vectors are hired, divided into {{layout.numOfWCKABS}} cross-teams, who welcome the new students in January 2024. -->
