<p>The study start hires around {{layout.numOfVectors}} vectors divided into {{layout.numOfKABS}} teams for the summer study start and around
{{layout.numOfWVectors}} vectors divided into {{layout.numOfWCKABS}} teams for the winter study start. Together they welcome the russes that begin in August for the summer and in January in the winter. This is coordinated by 30 KABS, that takes care of educational days, OPtur, study programmes and much more related to the study start. KABS, vectors and hyttebumser jointly creates the best possible study start for the russes.
