<p>When ordering with the new system, download the sheet as an excel file and edit it on your own computer. <b>ONLY</b> edit the blue fields.</p>
<p>When you're done, please send the filled sheet as an Excel-compatible formatted file to <a href="mailto:studiestartKABS@pf.dk?subject=Order for [trip name]">studiestartKABS@pf.dk</a>. Put <i>"Order for [trip name]"</i> in the subject. Feel free to write in Danish. </p>
<p>Please name the file as <i>[trip name]</i>. <b>Please make sure to attach the file directly to the email itself, and not a shared link to a Google Drive. We do not have access to SharePoint sharing.</b></p>
<p>Write in the email, if you need assistance to pick-up the bathtub. Otherwise, it will be assumed that your KABS will help with pick-up and drop-off.</p>
