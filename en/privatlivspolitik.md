<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
    When you apply to volunteer in the studystart for Polyteknisk Forening (PF) you entrust us with some of your information. 
    We view this as a great responsibility and take steps to protect your information and to give you control over them.
    We also refer to <a href="https://www.pf.dk/en/about-pf/privacy-policy">PF's general privacy policy</a>.
</p>

<h2>Information that PF collects</h2>
<p>
When you apply to volunteer in the studystart, we ask you to provide some personal information. This information consists of the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Study number</li>
    <li>Study line</li>
    <li>First and middle name</li>
    <li>Last name</li>
    <li>E-mail</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Driver's license status</li>
    <li>Which team-type you prefer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vector</h3>
<p>
Additionally, being a vector requires you to be a member of PF. In the context of creating your PF membership, we will ask you for some additional information:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Gender</li>
    <li>Birthday</li>
    <li>Expected graduation year/month</li>
    <li>Year of enrollment</li>
    <li>Summer / Winter start</li>
</ul>

<h2>How is the data we collect used</h2>
<h3>Member database</h3>
<p>
The main purpose of collecting your personal data is, to create and maintain a database of all applicants for volunteer work in the PF studystart.
This database is necessary to administrate the applications and the logistics behind the recruitment interviews given to the volunteers. It should be noted that nothing in your application will have an influence on whether or not you will be hired, 
and that all information gathered here will exclusively be used for logistic purposes.
</p>

<h3>Distribution of volunteers</h3>
<p>
Since we need to distribute volunteers into different parts of the studystart, it is necessary for us to use the data from our database for this purpose.
</p>

<h2>Options and obligations</h2>
<h3>Protection of personal data</h3>
<p>
We keep your personal data on servers and computers with limited access. These are placed in controlled facilities. We have safeguards in place, that control whether your personal data is handled responsibly, concerning your rights.
In short that means, that PF stores your personal data confidentially.
</p>

<h3>Insight in data</h3>
<p>
Should you wish to know what data we have registered about you, in our member database, you can contact us via kabs@pf.dk. As we take good care of your data, you will be asked to identify yourself, before we disclose any data.
</p>

<h3>Updating data</h3>
<p>
If the information we have on you is incorrect, if you move, get a new e-mail or the like, you can always request the data be updated by contacting us via kabs@pf.dk.
</p>

<h3>Data lifetime</h3>
<p>
If you are hired we store the data until the end of your volunteering period. In the case that you are not hired at first, we store the data for up to 6 months, should a relevant position open up.
In this case we will possibly contact you to offer you the position, and the data will then likewise be stored until the end of your volunteering period.
</p>

<h3>Who can access my data?</h3>
<p>
In most cases it is only KABS (Coorinators of the Bachelor Studystart), the board of PF, and PF employees, who have permission to access the data. In some cases this will be different, and if such it will be clear from the application which additional parties can
access your data. An example of this is if you apply as a cabin bum, where your data will also be visible to the vectors from the trips you apply to.
</p>

<h3>Deleting data</h3>
<p>
Should you wish to be deleted entirely from our database, please contact us via kabs@pf.dk. Subsequently all personal data we have on you, will be erased.
