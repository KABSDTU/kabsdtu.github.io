<h1>Become a cabin bum!</h1>

<p>It's time to apply to become a cabin bum on a rus trip this summer! </p>

<p>Attention: KABS18 would like to inform you, that due to changes in the cabin-contracts, it is no longer permittet to bring hard liquor (Defined as everything with a percentage over 16.5), these rules are also effective for cabin bums. This also includes shots, such as Sourz or Fisk. It is, however, quite alright to bring your own beer or wine to the trips.</p>
