<h1>Become a cabin bum!</h1>

<p>Applications are not open, but gather your team of bums and get ready to apply! </p>

<p>Attention: KABS19 would like to inform you, that due to changes in the cabin-contracts, it is no longer permittet to bring hard liquor (Defined as everything with a percentage over 15), these rules are also effective for cabin bums. This also includes shots, such as Sourz or Fisk. It is, however, quite alright to bring your own beer or wine to the trips.</p>
