<p>There are many benefits to being a vector.</p>

<p>The biggest and probably most important is the social community and network that one gains being a vector.</p>

<p>You will get the opportunity to connect with people across studylines and years, as well as being invited to parties and other social events. You may find this relevant in the future for both social and academic projects. 
</p>

<p>
As a vector, you will get to take responsibility for, and leave your mark on various projects in regards to studystart. The experience which comes with planning the various events including the introtrip, Welcome Day and studylineâ€™s cabintrip, etc. will be useful later on. On introtrips and studyline cabintrips things like finances, schedules, materials, etc. must be kept in order. This gives you as a vector the possibility for greater responsibility and personal development.
</p>

<p>
As a vector, you will be trained in various speaking techniques, conflict management and other person-oriented skills. This gives you a good foundation, and helps you to be welcoming to the new students and focus on their needs. In addition, you will also gain a much greater insight into the structure of PF, the board and various clubs etc., which all have a lot to offer all students at DTU.
</p>

<p>
You will also build a unique network at DTU and in PF, which may be highly relevant in the future for social and professional projects.
