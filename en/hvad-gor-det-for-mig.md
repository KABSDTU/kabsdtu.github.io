As a vector, you will get to take responsibility for, and leave your mark on various projects in regards to studystart. The experience which comes with planning the various events including the rustrip, Welcome Day and studylineâ€™s cabintrip, etc. will be useful later on. On rustrips and studyline cabintrips things like finances, schedules, materials, etc. must be kept in order. This gives you as a vector the possibility for greater responsibility.

As a vector, you will be trained in various speaking techniques, conflict management and other person-oriented skills. This gives you a good foundation, and helps you to be welcoming to the new students and focus on their needs. In addition, you will also gain a much greater insight into the structure of PF, the board and various clubs etc., which all have a lot to offer all students at DTU.

You will also build a unique network at DTU and in PF, which may be highly relevant in the future for social and professional projects.
