<h1>So you want to be a Vektor, huh?</h1>

<p>As a vektor you will be a part of two groups: a study programme group and a cross group. The study programme group will consist of vektors for the same study programme as you, while the cross group will consist of vektors from different study programme groups. These groups are the ones you have to cooperate with throughout your vektor period. In the cross group your main responsibility will be to plan and hold the rus trip. In the study programme group your responsibilities will be to plan the intro-day for the russes, amongst other events relevant for the study programme you represent. For General Engineering the study programme group and the cross group are the same.</p>

<p>Your first official task as a vektor will be to greet the russes on the intro-day. It is this day that the russes will meet their fellow students for the first time. This is also the day you will be introduced to the group of russes that you have to follow throughout the entirety of their first semester. The russes will be introduced to their study programme, to the campus and will generally receive their first impression of DTU. In the study programme group you will also be responsible for planning study relevant events, such as studycafés, trips to the movies and more, which you will decide on as a group.

<p>To become a vektor you have to be a member of PF. If you aren’t one yet, you can sign up at the PF secretary.
