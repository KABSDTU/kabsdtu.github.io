<p>As a vector you will be a part of two teams: a study programme team and a cross team. The study programme team will consist of vectors for the same study programme as you, while the cross team will consist of vectors from different study programme teams. These teams are the ones you have to cooperate with throughout your vector period. In the cross team your main responsibility will be to organize and excecute the rus trip. In the study programme team your responsibilities will be to plan the intro-day for the russes, amongst other events relevant for the study programme you represent.</p>

<p>Your first official task as a vector will be to greet the russes on the intro-day. It is this day that the russes will meet their fellow students for the first time. This is also the day you will be introduced to the group of russes that you have to follow throughout the entirety of their first semester. The russes will be introduced to their study programme, to the campus and will generally receive their first impression of DTU. In the study programme group you will also be responsible for planning study relevant events, such as studycafés, trips to the movies and more, which you will decide on as a group.

<p>To become a vector you have to be a member of PF. If you aren’t one yet, you can sign up at the PF secretary.
