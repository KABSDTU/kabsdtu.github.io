In PF and KABS, we do everything we can to include everyone, even if you aren’t necessarily Danish-speaking, or if you start on the international studyline <em>General Engineering</em> (abbreviated GE). Therefore, there is a chance to go on an international introday trip - the so-called <em>Mixed Team</em>. On this type of trip, the organizers (KABS, vectors and Chefs) will only speak English, and Russes are strongly encouraged to do the same, as this greatly helps the feeling of community on the trip. Apart from the spoken language, this type of trip functions largely like the other rustrips that are most often held.

<h2>Mixed trip</h2>
<p>
On a Mixed Trip, a team is made of Russes from GE, and people from other study lines who have chosen to go on an English-speaking trip. Mixed trip aims to mix people from different backgrounds and allow non-Danish-speaking Russes to meet Russes from other study lines and vice versa. The size of these trips is not yet determined, but will be disclosed later. The vectors on Mixed Trip trips are also from both <em>GE</em> and other studylines. It is not a requirement to be fluent in English to be a mixtrip vector.

The Mixtrip is the classical 4-day cabin rustrip – the only difference being the language as it is in English. It is a rustrip made up of russes from GE (General Engineering) and russes from other study programs, who also want to go on the international trips. This is an attempt to mix more people with different backgrounds and allow non-Danish-speaking russes to meet russes from other studies at DTU and vice versa. Danish vectors will get the chance of sharing Danish culture as well as learning about foreign cultures and how to handle a big group of people with different backgrounds. The size of these trips is between 7 and 10 vectors and include vectors from all study lines at DTU – and definitely some from GE.
