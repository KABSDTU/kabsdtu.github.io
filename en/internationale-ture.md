<h1>International trip</h1>
<p>
PF and KABS do everything to include everyone, even if you are not necessarily Danish-speaking and start at the international study <em>General Engineering (GE)</em>. That is why PF provides the opportunity to come on a international trip. The so called <em>Mixed Trip</em>. On both trips, the organizers (KABS, vectors, cabin bums), speak English and Danish and participants are encouraged to do the same as it greatly helps the fellowship on the trip.

<h2>Mixed trip</h2>
<p>
The first mixed trip held was in 2019 as test. The mixed trip serves as a way to mix GE's and the other russes on trips. That is, a rus trip made up of russes from <em>GE</em> and russes from other studies who also want to go on one the international trips. This is an attempt to mix more people with different backgrounds and allow non-Danish-speaking russes to meet russes from other studies at DTU and vice versa. The size of these trips is less determined at present and therefire the number of vectors and cabin bums cannot be specified. These trips include vectors from <em>GE</em> and vectors from other studies to create a mix of people. These vectors from <em>GE</em> are also vectors for <em>GE</em>.
