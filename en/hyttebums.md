<h1> Cabin Bum </h1>

<p> Are you crazy about food, or just crazy? As a cabin bum, you stand with your fellow bums to plan the menu, buy the ingredients, cook the food and maintain the necessary level of hygiene in the kitchen during the cabin trip. At the same time, you help create the unique atmosphere together with the Vector team, which organizes the cabin tour.</p>

<p> The cabin trips are on a weekend between weeks 38-44. You can search alone or with your friends as a team. As a rule, 3-4 cabin bums must be used on each trip. On the biggest trips, more must be used. Cabintrip bums are something you only apply for after the vectors have been chosen. </p>

<h1> Bums in the new study start? </h1>

<p> Currently, we as KABS know how the study start will generally proceed, but we do not have the opportunity to go into details yet. So we also don't know if there will be bums during the intro days this year, and if so, how much the role will take up. As much as possible, we would like to have bums with us during the introduction days, and as soon as we have more information about this, we will publish it, both here and on the KABS DTU Facebook page. </p>
