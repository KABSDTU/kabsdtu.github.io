<h1>Time spent on being a vector</h1>

<p>It takes time to be a vector. Some periods are more demanding than others. As a minimum, you should count on one evening meeting per week and a bigger effort to make a costume for OPtur, as well as by the end of the summer break. The last week in August is the rus trip, which is preceded by a preparation trip, that each group has to plan.</p>

<p>If you apply as a vector, there will be an interview with the KABS that is responsible for the study programme you applied for.</p> 

<p>The vector work is very flexible except for the preparation trips. This work includes the planning of various social events, keeping a budget internally or externally and to make sure your russes are satisfied. However, there are some dates, that requires participation to be a vector:</p>

<li>Hello-vector-Party (28th Februaryy)</li>
<li>First educational day (17th March)</li>
<li>OPtur (12th - 16th April)</li>
<li>Second educational day (27th April)</li>
<li>First Aid (One if the following days: 1st, 2nd, 8th or 9th June)</li>
<li>Intro-day (23th August)</li>
<li>Rus trip (23th  - 30th August depending on the type of trip)</li>

<p>The time and effort that is put into the vector work canâ€™t be measured against the friendship and the personal experience that is gained during the vector period.</p>
