<h1>Time spent on being a vektor</h1>

<p>It takes time to be a vektor. Some periods are more demanding than others. As a minimum, you should count on one evening meeting per week and a bigger effort to make a costume for OPtur, as well as by the end of the summer break. The last week in August is the rus trip, which is preceded by a preparation trip, that each group has to plan.</p>

<p>If you apply as a vektor, there will be an interview with the KABS that is responsible for the study programme you applied for.</p> 

<p>The vektor work is very flexible except for the preparation trips. This work includes the planning of various social events, keeping a budget internally or externally and to make sure your russes are satisfied. However, there are some dates, that requires participation to be a vektor:</p>

<li>Hello-Vector-Party (15. February)</li>
<li>Educational days (4. March & 28. April)</li>
<li>OPtur (23-27 March)</li>
<li>First Aid (one of the days: 26 May, 27. May, 2. June, 3. June, 9. June or 10. June)</li>
<li>Intro-day (24. August 2018)</li>
<li>Rus trip; Entire Week (27-31 August), Weekend (24-26 August)</li>

<p>The time and effort that is put into the vector work canâ€™t be measured against the friendship and the personal experience that is gained during the vector period.</p>
