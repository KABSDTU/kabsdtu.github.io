<h1>Time consumption as a vector</h1>

<div id="poster-image" style="height: 335px; background-image: url('/static/img/billedekabs1.jpg');">
</div>

<p>Being a vector takes some time, and some periods will be more time consuming than others.</p>


<p>
If you are interested in being a vector, there will be an employment interview with the KABS responsible for the studyline youâ€™ve applied to. You have to count on having one meeting a week, and some effort in costume sewing for OPtur on Easter break. The introdays will be in the end of August, and before then there's preparation trips, which you plan yourself with the rest of your vector teams.

<p>
The time and work put into the vector job can't be measured against the connections, the personal experiences and the knowledge you gain during your vector period. And besides, it's just great fun.
